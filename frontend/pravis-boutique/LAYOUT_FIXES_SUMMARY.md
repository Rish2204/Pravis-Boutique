# Layout & Logo Issues - Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Logo Display Problems
- **Issue**: The `/pravis-logo.png` was showing as a question mark or not loading properly
- **Root Cause**: Missing error handling and fallback mechanisms for logo loading
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added proper error handling with `@error` and `@load` event handlers
  - Implemented fallback logo display showing "P" when image fails to load
  - Added reactive data properties to track logo loading state
  - Applied the fix to both main page (`pages/index.vue`) and ConsentDialog component

### 2. Content Cutoff & Overflow Issues
- **Issue**: Content was being cut off on smaller screens and causing horizontal scroll
- **Root Cause**: Missing responsive CSS and inadequate container constraints
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added `overflow-x: hidden` to body and #app to prevent horizontal scrolling
  - Implemented proper container max-widths and padding
  - Added comprehensive responsive breakpoints:
    - Mobile (< 640px): Compact layouts, smaller logos, stacked buttons
    - Small mobile (< 480px): Further size reductions
    - Very small (< 375px): Minimal text sizes
    - Tablet (< 768px): Medium-sized adjustments

### 3. Responsive CSS Improvements
- **Issue**: UI elements not rendering correctly on all device sizes
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient responsive design implementation
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Enhanced floating button responsiveness:
    - Desktop: Full text + icon
    - Tablet: Smaller text
    - Mobile: Icon only
  - Improved logo showcase scaling:
    - Desktop: 150px × 150px
    - Mobile: 120px × 120px
    - Small mobile: 100px × 100px
  - Enhanced hero title responsiveness:
    - Desktop: 6xl text
    - Mobile: 3rem
    - Small mobile: 2.5rem
    - Very small: 2rem
  - Added button width constraints on mobile (max-width: 280px)

### 4. CSS Architecture Improvements
- **Global Layout Fixes**:
  - Added proper container constraints (max-width: 1200px)
  - Implemented overflow prevention for all sections
  - Added grid responsiveness for feature cards
  - Enhanced flex layout responsiveness

- **Component-Specific Fixes**:
  - ConsentDialog: Improved mobile scaling (95vw on small screens)
  - Cards: Better padding and spacing on mobile
  - Buttons: Enhanced mobile interaction areas
