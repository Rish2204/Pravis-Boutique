## Introduction

This document provides guidance for maintaining high accessibility standards and performance metrics for the Pravis Boutique application. Following these practices ensures our application is usable by all people, including those with disabilities, and performs well across all devices.

## Accessibility Standards

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

Our application aims to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance, focusing on:

1. **Perceivable**
   - All non-text content has text alternatives
   - Time-based media has captions and audio descriptions
   - Content can be presented in different ways without losing information
   - Content is easy to see and hear

2. **Operable**
   - All functionality is available from a keyboard
   - Users have enough time to read and use content
   - Content doesn't cause seizures or physical reactions
   - Users can easily navigate and find content

3. **Understandable**
   - Text is readable and understandable
   - Content appears and operates in predictable ways
   - Users are helped to avoid and correct mistakes

4. **Robust**
   - Content is compatible with current and future user tools

### Accessibility Implementation Checklist

- [x] **ARIA roles and attributes** for all interactive elements
- [x] **Keyboard navigation** for all interactive elements
- [x] **Focus management** for modals and custom components
- [x] **Auditory feedback** for important actions
- [x] **Screen reader announcements** for dynamic content changes
- [x] **Proper heading structure** for content organization
- [x] **Color contrast** meeting WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- [x] **Resizable text** without loss of content or functionality
- [x] **Alternative text** for all images
- [x] **Form labels** for all form controls
- [x] **Error identification** and suggestions for correction
- [x] **Consistent navigation** across the application

## Core Web Vitals Optimization

Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers important for user experience. Optimizing these metrics improves both accessibility and overall performance.

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

**Target: < 2.5 seconds**

Optimization techniques:
- Optimize image loading with proper sizing and formats
- Implement responsive images using `srcset` attribute
- Use preload for critical resources
- Implement server-side rendering or static generation for key pages
- Optimize server response times

```html
<!-- Example of responsive images -->
<img 
  src="product-small.jpg"
  srcset="product-small.jpg 400w, product-medium.jpg 800w, product-large.jpg 1200w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 1200px) 800px, 1200px"
  alt="Product description"
  loading="lazy"
>
```

### First Input Delay (FID)

**Target: < 100 milliseconds**

Optimization techniques:
- Break up long tasks into smaller ones
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Use Web Workers for heavy computations
- Minimize unused JavaScript
- Implement code splitting

```js
// Example of code splitting in Nuxt
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  build: {
    splitChunks: {
      layouts: true,
      pages: true,
      commons: true
    }
  }
})
```

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

**Target: < 0.1**

Optimization techniques:
- Set explicit width and height for images and embeds
- Reserve space for dynamic content
- Avoid inserting content above existing content
- Use CSS transform for animations instead of properties that trigger layout
- Preload fonts to avoid text shifts

```html
<!-- Example of preventing layout shift with images -->
<div style="aspect-ratio: 16/9;">
  <img src="product.jpg" alt="Product description" width="800" height="450">
</div>
```

## Lighthouse Accessibility Metrics

Lighthouse is an open-source tool that helps improve the quality of web pages. Its accessibility audit checks for issues that could affect users with disabilities.

### Running Lighthouse

```bash
# Install Lighthouse CLI
npm install -g lighthouse

# Run an accessibility audit
lighthouse https://pravis-boutique.com --only-categories=accessibility --view
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Navigation**
   - Proper heading structure
   - Skip navigation links
   - Keyboard navigation support

2. **ARIA**
   - Valid ARIA attributes
   - ARIA roles used properly
   - ARIA attributes match their roles

3. **Color and Contrast**
   - Sufficient contrast ratio (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
   - Not using color alone to convey information

4. **Names and Labels**
   - Form elements have associated labels
   - Links have discernible text
   - Images have alt text

5. **Additional Items**
   - Document has a `<title>` element
   - Document has a valid `lang` attribute
   - Document avoids meta refresh

### Automated Testing Integration

We have integrated accessibility testing into our CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Accessibility Testing

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  lighthouse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build project
        run: npm ci && npm run build
      - name: Start server
        run: npm run start & npx wait-on http://localhost:3000
      - name: Run Lighthouse
        uses: treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v8
        with:
          urls: |
            http://localhost:3000/
            http://localhost:3000/shop
            http://localhost:3000/checkout
          configPath: './.github/lighthouse-config.json'
          uploadArtifacts: true
```

## Testing Procedures

### Automated Testing

We use the following tools for automated accessibility testing:

1. **Jest-Axe**: Unit tests for component accessibility
2. **Cypress-Axe**: End-to-end tests for page accessibility
3. **Lighthouse CI**: Performance and accessibility audits in CI

```js
// Example Jest-Axe test
it('should be accessible', async () => {
  const wrapper = mount(Button)
  const results = await axe(wrapper.element)
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations()
})
```

### Manual Testing

Manual testing is crucial for aspects that automated tools cannot fully validate:

1. **Screen Reader Testing**
   - Test with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver
   - Verify all content is announced correctly
   - Check that dynamic updates are announced

2. **Keyboard Navigation Testing**
   - Verify all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Test focus order is logical
   - Ensure focus trapping in modals works correctly

3. **Cognitive Testing**
   - Verify instructions are clear and concise
   - Check error messages are helpful
   - Ensure forms are easy to understand and complete

### Core Flow Testing Checklist

We test the following core flows for accessibility:

1. **Navigation**
   - [ ] Menu navigation with keyboard
   - [ ] Skip links work correctly
   - [ ] Focus states are clearly visible

2. **Search**
   - [ ] Search input is properly labeled
   - [ ] Search results are announced to screen readers
   - [ ] No layout shifts when results load

3. **Product Browsing**
