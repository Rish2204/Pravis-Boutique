    "@azure/cognitiveservices-speech-sdk": "^1.34.0"
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables to Configure

```bash
# Voice Agent Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
VOICE_API_KEY=your_voice_security_key
WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE=base  # tiny, base, small, medium, large
TTS_VOICE_MODEL=nova     # alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer
VOICE_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT=30

```

## Testing Checklist

### Voice Recognition Testing
- [ ] Clear speech recognition
- [ ] Noisy environment handling
- [ ] Multiple accent support
- [ ] Command accuracy validation
- [ ] Response time benchmarking

### Text-to-Speech Testing
- [ ] Voice quality assessment
- [ ] Speed and timing optimization
- [ ] Emotion and tone consistency
- [ ] Multi-language pronunciation
- [ ] Audio caching validation

### Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Keyboard navigation integration
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 compliance
- [ ] Motor disability accommodation
- [ ] Cognitive load assessment

### PWA Integration Testing
- [ ] Product navigation voice commands
- [ ] Shopping cart voice controls
- [ ] Search functionality validation
- [ ] Checkout process assistance
- [ ] Error handling and recovery

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics
- **Voice Recognition Latency**: < 2 seconds
- **TTS Generation Time**: < 1 second
- **Command Processing**: < 500ms
- **Cache Hit Rate**: > 80%
- **Offline Functionality**: Basic commands only

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Audio Preprocessing**:
   - Noise reduction algorithms
   - Voice activity detection
   - Audio quality enhancement

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Frequent commands cached locally
   - TTS responses cached in browser
   - Model warming for faster responses

3. **Fallback Systems**:
   - Browser Speech API as primary
   - Whisper API as enhanced backup
   - Text-only mode for unsupported browsers

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- [ ] Voice data encryption in transit
- [ ] Temporary audio file cleanup
- [ ] GDPR compliance documentation
- [ ] User consent management
- [ ] Data retention policies

### API Security
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] API key rotation strategy
- [ ] Request validation and sanitization
- [ ] Audit logging for voice interactions
- [ ] Error message sanitization

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
```bash
# Local development setup
cd /Users/rish/Developer/Automation-Playground
git checkout feature/ai-voice-agent

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Start development servers
# Backend: uvicorn voice_api:app --reload
# Frontend: npm run dev
```

### Production Deployment
- **Azure Container Instances** for Whisper processing
- **Azure CDN** for TTS audio caching
- **Azure Application Gateway** for load balancing
- **Azure Key Vault** for API key management

## Next Steps

1. **Create initial project structure**
2. **Setup basic Web Speech API integration**
3. **Test voice recognition accuracy**
4. **Implement basic navigation commands**
5. **Add text-to-speech responses**

This roadmap provides a clear path from basic voice functionality to a comprehensive AI voice assistant integrated into your boutique PWA.
