2. **Fast Performance**: Optimized for speed while maintaining high quality responses.
3. **Cost-Effective GPT-4**: More affordable than GPT-4 Turbo while maintaining strong capabilities.
4. **Real-Time Applications**: Excellent for chat applications and interactive development environments.

### GPT-4 Turbo
1. **Large Context Window**: 128K token context window allows processing of extensive codebases.
2. **Advanced Reasoning**: Strong analytical capabilities for complex problem-solving.
3. **Updated Knowledge**: Training data up to April 2023, more current than base GPT-4.
4. **Vision Capabilities**: Can analyze images and diagrams, useful for UI/UX discussions.

### GPT-4
1. **Reliable Performance**: The original GPT-4 with proven stability and consistency.
2. **Strong Coding**: Excellent for code generation, debugging, and explanations.
3. **Nuanced Understanding**: Better at understanding context and implied requirements.
4. **Higher Cost**: More expensive than GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o variants.

### GPT-3.5 Turbo
1. **Fast and Affordable**: Quick responses at a low cost, suitable for most common tasks.
2. **Good for Prototyping**: Ideal for initial development and testing phases.
3. **16K Context**: Sufficient context window for most coding tasks.
4. **Widely Compatible**: Well-supported across various platforms and tools.

## Gemini Models (Google)

### Gemini 1.5 Pro
1. **Massive Context Window**: Up to 2 million tokens, can process entire codebases or documentation.
2. **Multimodal Native**: Built-in support for text, code, images, audio, and video.
3. **Strong Reasoning**: Excellent analytical capabilities for complex technical problems.
4. **Google Integration**: Seamless integration with Google Cloud services and tools.

### Gemini 1.5 Flash
1. **Speed Optimized**: Faster inference times while maintaining quality.
2. **Cost-Effective**: Lower pricing than Pro model, good for high-volume applications.
3. **Multimodal Support**: Handles text, code, and images efficiently.
4. **Long Context**: 1 million token context window, suitable for large projects.

### Gemini 1.0 Pro
1. **Balanced Performance**: Good trade-off between capability and cost.
2. **API Stability**: Mature API with good documentation and support.
3. **32K Context**: Sufficient for most development tasks.
4. **Text Focus**: Optimized for text and code generation tasks.
