# Documentation, Monitoring, and Scaling Guide

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Pravis Boutique API project, focusing on:

1. Developer documentation
2. User/AI agent interaction logging
3. Scaling strategies 
4. Feedback and analytics collection

## Documentation Files

- [Developer Guide](./developer_guide.md) - Comprehensive guide for developers working on the project
- [Monitoring Guide](./monitoring_guide.md) - Details on how to monitor and log user/AI interactions
- [Scaling Strategy](./scaling_strategy.md) - Plan for scaling the application as user demand grows
- [Feedback & Analytics Guide](./feedback_analytics_guide.md) - How to collect and act on user feedback

## Implementation Details

### AI Interaction Logging

We've implemented comprehensive logging of user-AI interactions through:

- Database models in `app/models/ai_interaction.py`
- Pydantic schemas in `app/schemas/ai_interaction.py` 
- Repository functions in `app/repositories/ai_interaction.py`
- API endpoints in `app/api/api_v1/endpoints/ai_analytics.py`

### Azure Integration

The application integrates with several Azure services:

- **Azure Key Vault** for secret management
- **Azure Application Insights** for real-time monitoring
- **Azure Log Analytics** for log storage and analysis
- **Azure Blob Storage** for media file storage
- **Azure CDN** for content delivery (planned)

### Database Migration

A database migration script (`002_add_ai_interaction_tables.py`) has been created to add the necessary tables for AI interaction logging.

Run the migration using:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Developer Guide](./developer_guide.md) for a complete overview of the project
2. Set up the required environment variables as specified in the documentation
3. Run the database migrations to create the interaction logging tables
4. Use the API endpoints to start logging and analyzing AI interactions

## Next Steps

- Deploy monitoring dashboards using Azure PowerBI
- Implement advanced sentiment analysis for feedback
- Set up automated reporting for AI performance metrics
- Create admin interface for viewing analytics data
