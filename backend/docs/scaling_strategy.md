## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for scaling the Pravis Boutique API as user demand grows. The approach prioritizes maintainability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness while ensuring a smooth user experience even under heavy load.

## Architectural Principles

### Stateless Services

All application services are designed to be stateless, allowing for:
- Horizontal scaling without session-related issues
- Easy replacement of failing instances
- Simplified deployment and rollback procedures

Implementation:
- User sessions are managed via JWT tokens
- Temporary state is stored in Redis
- Persistent data is stored in the database
- No local file storage on application servers

### Microservices (Future)

As the application grows, consider splitting into microservices:
- Voice processing service
- Authentication service
- Analytics service
- Main API service

### Cloud-Native Approach

The application is designed to leverage Azure cloud capabilities:
- Container-based deployment (Azure Container Instances/AKS)
- Managed services where appropriate
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Azure Resource Manager templates or Terraform
- Auto-scaling based on demand

## Database Scaling

### Vertical Scaling (Initial Approach)

- Increase database resources (CPU, memory, storage)
- Suitable for early growth phases
- Minimal application changes required
- Limitations in scalability

### Horizontal Scaling (Advanced)

#### Read Replicas

- Deploy read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Application logic to route queries appropriately:
  ```python
  # Example read/write separation
  async def get_user_by_id(user_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_read_db)):
      return db.query(User).filter(User.id == user_id).first()
      
  async def create_user(user: UserCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_write_db)):
      db_user = User(**user.dict())
      db.add(db_user)
      db.commit()
      db.refresh(db_user)
      return db_user
  ```

#### Database Sharding

When data volume exceeds single-instance capacity:

1. **Identify Sharding Key**:
   - Usually `user_id` or `tenant_id`
   - Must be included in most queries

2. **Sharding Strategy**:
   - Range-based sharding (e.g., users A-M on shard 1, N-Z on shard 2)
   - Hash-based sharding (more evenly distributed)

3. **Implementation**:
   ```python
   def get_db_for_user(user_id: str):
       shard_number = hash(user_id) % NUMBER_OF_SHARDS
       return db_connections[shard_number]
   ```

4. **Cross-Shard Queries**:
   - Avoid if possible
   - Use aggregation services for necessary cross-shard operations
   - Consider a separate analytics database for reporting

## Application Scaling

### Container-Based Deployment

- All application components are containerized
- Azure Container Instances for simple deployment
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for advanced orchestration

### Auto-Scaling

1. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (if using AKS)**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
   kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
   metadata:
     name: pravis-api-hpa
   spec:
     scaleTargetRef:
       apiVersion: apps/v1
       kind: Deployment
       name: pravis-api
     minReplicas: 2
     maxReplicas: 10
     metrics:
     - type: Resource
       resource:
         name: cpu
         target:
           type: Utilization
           averageUtilization: 70
   ```

2. **Azure App Service Auto-Scaling**:
   - CPU-based scaling (70% threshold)
   - Schedule-based scaling for predictable traffic patterns
   - Configure scale-out/scale-in rules with appropriate cool-down periods

### Deployment Strategies

- Blue-Green deployment for zero-downtime updates
- Canary deployments for high-risk changes
- A/B testing capability for new features

## Caching Strategy

### Multi-Level Caching

1. **Application-Level Cache (Redis)**:
   - API responses
   - Authentication tokens
   - Session data
   - Configuration

2. **CDN for Static Assets**:
   - Azure CDN for media files
   - Voice samples, exports, and other static content
   - Global distribution for lower latency

3. **Database Query Cache**:
   - Frequently accessed reference data
   - User profiles and preferences
   - Results of expensive queries

### Cache Invalidation

- TTL-based expiration for most cached data
- Event-based invalidation for critical updates:
  ```python
  async def update_user_profile(user_id: str, profile_data: dict):
      # Update database
      user_repository.update(user_id, profile_data)
      
      # Invalidate cache
      cache_key = f"user_profile:{user_id}"
      await redis.delete(cache_key)
      
      # Publish event for distributed invalidation
      await redis.publish("cache_invalidation", json.dumps({
          "resource_type": "user_profile",
          "resource_id": user_id
      }))
  ```

## Storage Scaling

### Azure Blob Storage

- Used for all persistent file storage
- Automatically scales with usage
- Implement lifecycle management policies:
  - Move infrequently accessed data to cool storage
  - Archive older data
  - Auto-delete temporary data

### Content Delivery

- Use Azure CDN to deliver media content
- Implement Shared Access Signatures (SAS) for secure access

## Secret Management

### Azure Key Vault Integration

All sensitive configuration is stored in Azure Key Vault:
- Database credentials
- API keys
- TLS/SSL certificates
- Encryption keys

Implementation:
```python
# In app/core/config.py
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # ... other settings ...
    
    # Key Vault integration
    KEY_VAULT_URL: Optional[str] = os.getenv("KEY_VAULT_URL")
    
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        
        # Load secrets from Key Vault in non-development environments
        if self.ENVIRONMENT != "development" and self.KEY_VAULT_URL:
            credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
            secret_client = SecretClient(vault_url=self.KEY_VAULT_URL, credential=credential)
            
            # Load database credentials
            self.DB_PASSWORD = secret_client.get_secret("db-password").value
            self.SECRET_KEY = secret_client.get_secret("jwt-secret-key").value
            self.AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING = secret_client.get_secret("storage-connection-string").value
```

### Managed Identities

- Use Azure Managed Identities for service-to-service authentication
- Eliminate need for storing service credentials
- Automatic credential rotation

## Load Balancing

### Azure Front Door

- Global load balancing and traffic management
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection
- HTTPS enforcement and TLS termination
- Geographic routing for multi-region deployments

### Health Checks

- Implement comprehensive health check endpoint:
  ```python
  @router.get("/health")
  async def health_check():
      health = {
          "status": "healthy",
          "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
          "version": "1.0.0",
          "components": {
              "database": await check_database_health(),
              "redis": await check_redis_health(),
              "azure_storage": await check_azure_storage_health()
          }
      }
      
      # If any component is unhealthy, mark the whole service as unhealthy
      if any(v != "healthy" for v in health["components"].values()):
          health["status"] = "unhealthy"
          return JSONResponse(content=health, status_code=503)
      
      return health
  ```

## Monitoring for Scale

### Capacity Planning Metrics

Monitor these key metrics for scaling decisions:
- CPU and memory usage (90th percentile)
- Request rate and latency
- Database connection pool utilization
- Cache hit/miss ratio
- Storage I/O and bandwidth

### Scaling Trigger Alerts

Set up alerts for:
- Sustained high CPU (>70% for 5 minutes)
- Memory pressure (>80% for 5 minutes)
- Response time degradation (>500ms p95)
- Error rate increases (>1% of requests)

## Cost Management

### Resource Optimization

- Right-size resources based on actual usage
- Implement auto-scaling to match demand
- Use reserved instances for predictable workloads
